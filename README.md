# DE1-Project

Created for a project during the course Data Engineering I 1TD069 VT 2022 at Uppsala University. A distributed system (Spark, HDFS, master node and three worker nodes) is used to determine which Subreddit has the greatest ratio of profane language. The Reddit comments were gathered from [the Pushshift initiative](http://files.pushshift.io/reddit/comments/). The dataset of dirty words were taken from the open-source repository [encycloDB](https://github.com/turalus/encycloDB/tree/master/Dirty%20Words).
